                <h1> 12 : Did you have irrational fears as a child?</h1>

                <p>
                    When I was a little kid, I was terrified I was going to get sucked into a black hole. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At one point during my elementary school career, we were learning about space and we had to choose a space-related topic to do research on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I chose black holes! 
                </p>
                <P>
                    Once I learned enough about them, I thought <i>Oh my god, they can open up anywhere at any time. And I could get sucked into one at any time! </i>
                </P>

                        I used to be afraid that everyone was actually a monster and that I was the only human in the world.

                    <p>
                        I was so convinced that the moment I went to sleep, they would all unzip their human costumes and that if I woke up I would see all of them in their true forms. 

                    </p>
